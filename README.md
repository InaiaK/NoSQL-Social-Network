# NoSQL-Social-Network

API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts.


 ## Description

Build and structure an back-end API for a social network using Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) for MongoDB where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. MongoDB is used for large platforms because of its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Use Insomnia to check all API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes
